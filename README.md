## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js 18.x+ and npm
* Access to a Snowflake instance and a Google AI Studio API Key.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.
2.  Copy and paste the following template into the `.env` file and fill in your credentials.

    ```env
    # Snowflake Credentials
    SNOWFLAKE_USER="your_snowflake_username"
    SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD="your_snowflake_password"
    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT="your_snowflake_account_identifier"
    SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE="your_warehouse"
    SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE="your_database"
    SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA="your_schema"

    # Google Gemini API Key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    ```

### üêç Backend Setup

1.  **Create Virtual Environment:**
    From the root directory, create and activate a Python virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Flask Server:**
    Start the backend API server. It will run on `http://localhost:5001`.
    ```bash
    python api.py
    ```
    Keep this terminal window open.

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**
    Open a **new terminal window** and navigate into the frontend project.
    ```bash
    cd aria-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the React Server:**
    Start the frontend development server. It will run on `http://localhost:5173` and should open automatically in your browser.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

You should now have both servers running and be able to access the application in your browser!
